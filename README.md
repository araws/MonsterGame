# Monster Game

This is my first 2-D game.

## Getting stared

This program is able to run only in console of IDE.

### Description

You ('P') have to eliminate each monster ('M').

### Controls

You can move by 1 field with numeric pad 789
                                         4 6
                                         123
You can randomly jump with 5

### To Do

- Game class is too big - it should be divided to one class responsible for randomization,
                          the other one responsible for menu
                          and the other one responsible for the rest.
                          
- There are some methods should be extract from code.
